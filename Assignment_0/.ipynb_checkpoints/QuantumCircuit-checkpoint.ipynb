This function takes in a quantum circuit and a backend. The backend is the device that we want to simulate the circuit on. For now, we will use the [statevector_simulator](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator.html) backend. This backend simulates the circuit on a quantum computer with infinite qubits. This is useful for testing our circuits before we run them on a real quantum computer. Remember those classical bits? We can use them to store the results of the simulation. We can do so by applying the [measure](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.measure.html) function. This function takes in a quantum register and a classical register. It then applies a measurement to the quantum register and stores the result in the classical register. We can then use the [get_counts](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.result.Result.get_counts.html) function to get the counts of the simulation. This function takes in a result object and returns a dictionary with the counts of the simulation. For example, if we run the following code:"
